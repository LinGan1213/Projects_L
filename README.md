# Projects_L

This is a list of projects using Python and C
## Table of Content
* _Data science_: Given the information on bike traffic across a number of bridges in New York City, analyze the overall traffic, the relation between the next day's weather forecast and the number of bicyclists. 
* _Building a calculator_: Includes two parts. The first part evaluate the Reverse Polish Notation and outputs the result of the computation. The second part builds a calculator using expression Tree.
* _Who gets the cake using linked list_: Same as Josephus Problem. Instead of deciding who to "kill", imagine that there is a piece of cake and several people want it. They decide who can have it by playing a game: They form a circle and choose an integer k greater than one. They count 1, 2, 3, ..., k. The k-th person is eliminated. They keep counting until only one person is left. This person who is left gets the cake.
* _Deep Learning_: Autoencoder, GAN, and CLDNN using mnist_classifier.
* _AT&T 5G Hackathon_: Teamwork Product. Our project makes use of Python, Java script and json packages to implement an Athlete Analyzer that monitors playersâ€™ emotion by taking their interview audio. The program takes in the mp3 audio and outputs it as a .wav file. It then transcribes the audio as a text file using speech recognition. By employing a library called text2emotion, we created word cloud image using word cloud API that took in a dictionary of emotions using python.
